/**
 * enum pin_config_param - possible pin configuration parameters
 * @PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_DISABLE: disable any pin bias on the pin, a
 *	transition from say pull-up to pull-down implies that you disable
 *	pull-up in the process, this setting disables all biasing.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_HIGH_IMPEDANCE: the pin will be set to a high impedance
 *	mode, also know as "third-state" (tristate) or "high-Z" or "floating".
 *	On output pins this effectively disconnects the pin, which is useful
 *	if for example some other pin is going to drive the signal connected
 *	to it for a while. Pins used for input are usually always high
 *	impedance.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_BUS_HOLD: the pin will be set to weakly latch so that it
 *	weakly drives the last value on a tristate bus, also known as a "bus
 *	holder", "bus keeper" or "repeater". This allows another device on the
 *	bus to change the value by driving the bus high or low and switching to
 *	tristate. The argument is ignored.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_PULL_UP: the pin will be pulled up (usually with high
 *	impedance to VDD). If the argument is != 0 pull-up is enabled,
 *	if it is 0, pull-up is disabled.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_PULL_DOWN: the pin will be pulled down (usually with high
 *	impedance to GROUND). If the argument is != 0 pull-down is enabled,
 *	if it is 0, pull-down is disabled.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_PULL_PIN_DEFAULT: the pin will be pulled up or down based
 *	on embedded knowledge of the controller, like current mux function.
 *	If the argument is != 0 pull up/down is enabled, if it is 0,
 *	the pull is disabled.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_DRIVE_PUSH_PULL: the pin will be driven actively high and
 *	low, this is the most typical case and is typically achieved with two
 *	active transistors on the output. Sending this config will enabale
 *	push-pull mode, the argument is ignored.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_DRIVE_OPEN_DRAIN: the pin will be driven with open drain (open
 *	collector) which means it is usually wired with other output ports
 *	which are then pulled up with an external resistor. Sending this
 *	config will enabale open drain mode, the argument is ignored.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_DRIVE_OPEN_SOURCE: the pin will be driven with open source
 *	(open emitter). Sending this config will enabale open drain mode, the
 *	argument is ignored.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_DRIVE_STRENGTH: the pin will output the current passed as
 * 	argument. The argument is in mA.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_INPUT_SCHMITT_ENABLE: control schmitt-trigger mode on the pin.
 *      If the argument != 0, schmitt-trigger mode is enabled. If it's 0,
 *      schmitt-trigger mode is disabled.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_INPUT_SCHMITT: this will configure an input pin to run in
 *	schmitt-trigger mode. If the schmitt-trigger has adjustable hysteresis,
 *	the threshold value is given on a custom format as argument when
 *	setting pins to this mode.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_INPUT_DEBOUNCE: this will configure the pin to debounce mode,
 *	which means it will wait for signals to settle when reading inputs. The
 *	argument gives the debounce time on a custom format. Setting the
 *	argument to zero turns debouncing off.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_POWER_SOURCE: if the pin can select between different power
 *	supplies, the argument to this parameter (on a custom format) tells
 *	the driver which alternative power source to use.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_SLEW_RATE: if the pin can select slew rate, the argument to
 * 	this parameter (on a custom format) tells the driver which alternative
 * 	slew rate to use.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_LOW_POWER_MODE: this will configure the pin for low power
 *	operation, if several modes of operation are supported these can be
 *	passed in the argument on a custom form, else just use argument 1
 *	to indicate low power mode, argument 0 turns low power mode off.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_OUTPUT: this will configure the pin in output, use argument
 *	1 to indicate high level, argument 0 to indicate low level.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_END: this is the last enumerator for pin configurations, if
 *	you need to pass in custom configurations to the pin controller, use
 *	PIN_CONFIG_END+1 as the base offset.
