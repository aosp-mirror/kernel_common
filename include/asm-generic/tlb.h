/*
 * Semi RCU freeing of the page directories.
 *
 * This is needed by some architectures to implement software pagetable walkers.
 *
 * gup_fast() and other software pagetable walkers do a lockless page-table
 * walk and therefore needs some synchronization with the freeing of the page
 * directories. The chosen means to accomplish that is by disabling IRQs over
 * the walk.
 *
 * Architectures that use IPIs to flush TLBs will then automagically DTRT,
 * since we unlink the page, flush TLBs, free the page. Since the disabling of
 * IRQs delays the completion of the TLB flush we can never observe an already
 * freed page.
 *
 * Architectures that do not have this (PPC) need to delay the freeing by some
 * other means, this is that means.
 *
 * What we do is batch the freed directory pages (tables) and RCU free them.
 * We use the sched RCU variant, as that guarantees that IRQ/preempt disabling
 * holds off grace periods.
 *
 * However, in order to batch these pages we need to allocate storage, this
 * allocation is deep inside the MM code and can thus easily fail on memory
 * pressure. To guarantee progress we fall back to single table freeing, see
 * the implementation of tlb_remove_table_one().
