	---help---
	  If you say Y here, then the rmnet_data module will be statically
	  compiled into the kernel. The rmnet data module provides MAP
	  functionality for embedded and bridged traffic.

config RMNET_DATA_FC
	bool "RmNet Data Flow Control"
	depends on NET_SCHED && NET_SCH_PRIO
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want RmNet data to handle in-band flow control and
	  ioctl based flow control. This depends on net scheduler and prio queue
	  capability being present in the kernel. In-band flow control requires
	  MAP protocol be used.
config RMNET_DATA_DEBUG_PKT
	bool "Packet Debug Logging"
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want RmNet data to be able to log packets in main
	  system log. This should not be enabled on production builds as it can
	  impact system performance. Note that simply enabling it here will not
	  enable the logging; it must be enabled at run-time as well.
