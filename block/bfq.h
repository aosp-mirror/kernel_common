 * @rb_node: service_tree member.

 *         the idle one of its service_tree).
 * @finish: B-WF2Q+ finish timestamp (aka F_i).
 * @start: B-WF2Q+ start timestamp (aka S_i).
 * @tree: tree the entity is enqueued into; %NULL if not on a tree.
 * @min_start: minimum start time of the (active) subtree rooted at
 *             this entity; used for O(log N) lookups into active trees.
 * @service: service received during the last round of service.
 * @budget: budget used to calculate F_i; F_i = S_i + @budget / @weight.
 * @weight: weight of the queue
 * @parent: parent entity, for hierarchical scheduling.
 * @my_sched_data: for non-leaf nodes in the cgroup hierarchy, the
 *                 associated scheduler queue, %NULL on leaf nodes.
 * @sched_data: the scheduler queue this entity belongs to.
 * @ioprio: the ioprio in use.
 * @new_weight: when a weight change is requested, the new weight value.
 * @orig_weight: original weight, used to implement weight boosting
 * @new_ioprio: when an ioprio change is requested, the new ioprio value.
 * @ioprio_class: the ioprio_class in use.
 * @new_ioprio_class: when an ioprio_class change is requested, the new
 *                    ioprio_class value.
 * @ioprio_changed: flag, true when the user requested a weight, ioprio or
 *                  ioprio_class change.
 *
 * A bfq_entity is used to represent either a bfq_queue (leaf node in the
 * cgroup hierarchy) or a bfq_group into the upper level scheduler.  Each
 * entity belongs to the sched_data of the parent group in the cgroup
 * hierarchy.  Non-leaf entities have also their own sched_data, stored
 * in @my_sched_data.
 *
 * Each entity stores independently its priority values; this would
 * allow different weights on different devices, but this
 * functionality is not exported to userspace by now.  Priorities and
 * weights are updated lazily, first storing the new values into the
 * new_* fields, then setting the @ioprio_changed flag.  As soon as
 * there is a transition in the entity state that allows the priority
 * update to take place the effective and the requested priority
 * values are synchronized.
 *
 * Unless cgroups are used, the weight value is calculated from the
 * ioprio to export the same interface as CFQ.  When dealing with
 * ``well-behaved'' queues (i.e., queues that do not spend too much
 * time to consume their budget and have true sequential behavior, and
 * when there are no external factors breaking anticipation) the
 * relative weights at each level of the cgroups hierarchy should be
 * guaranteed.  All the fields are protected by the queue lock of the
 * containing bfqd.
