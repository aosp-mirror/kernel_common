	 and FS USB which is connected over the PMIC. This support is
	 required for MSMs on which the APPS does not have a direct access
	 to the PMIC.

config MSM_RPC_PMAPP
	tristate "MSM RPC PMIC APP driver"
	depends on MSM_ONCRPCROUTER
	help
	 This driver supports the configuration of various PMIC APP modules
	 such as display backlight, vreg pin-ctrl, smps clock over the RPC
	 interface. This support is required for MSMs on which the APPS
	 does not have a direct access to the PMIC.

config MSM_ENABLE_WDOG_DEBUG_CONTROL
	bool "Enable control of watchdog debug and boot partition select"
	help
	  Enables support for controlling watchdog debug and boot partition
	  select. This is currently used to bypass debug image for PS_HOLD reset
	  by disabling watchdog debug and boot partition select. This allows
	  for a clean MSM reset for reboot scenarios.

config MSM_FIQ
	bool "Enable FIQ for debugging"
	depends on ARCH_MSM8625
	select FIQ
	select GIC_SECURE
	help
	  Enable any line to be used as an FIQ. This will help debugging
	  if apps is not responding and holding lock with irqs disabled.
	  Modem will then generate an raise a FIQ on this line before sending
	  SMSM reset.

config MSM_USE_USER_ACCESSIBLE_TIMERS
	bool "Enables mapping an MSM timer counter page to user space."
	depends on ARM_USE_USER_ACCESSIBLE_TIMERS
	help
	  Enables MSM-specific user accessible timers via a shared
	  memory page containing the cycle counter.

config USE_DEV_CTRL_VOLUME
	bool "Use Device Control Volume"
	help
	  Use Device Control Volume as opposed to ALSA volume control.

config MSM_CPU_PWRCTL
	bool "Ensures that krait droop detectors are always off"
	help
	  Droop detector mechanism can adversely affect krait plls during
	  stand alone power collapse operation. Selecting this option
	  ensures that they are always off.

config MSM_UARTDM_Core_v14
	bool "Use MSM BLSP based HSUART Core v1.4"
	depends on SERIAL_MSM_HS
	help
		Select if BLSP based UART Core v.14 or higher is present.

config MSM_COMMON_LOG
	bool "Use to export symbols for parsing memory dump"
	help
	 Use this to export symbols to a memory dump table. This table
	 can be used by post analysis tools to extract information from
	 memory when device crashes.

config MSM_BOOT_STATS
	bool "Use MSM boot stats reporting"
	help
	 Use this to report msm boot stats such as bootloader throughput,
	 display init, total boot time.
	 This figures are reported in mpm sleep clock cycles and have a
	 resolution of 31 bits as 1 bit is used as an overflow check.

config MSM_XPU_ERR_FATAL
	bool "Configure XPU violations as fatal errors"
	help
	 Select if XPU violations have to be configured as fatal errors.

config MSM_CPR_REGULATOR
	bool "RBCPR regulator driver for APC"
	depends on REGULATOR
	depends on OF
	help
	  Compile in RBCPR (RapidBridge Core Power Reduction) driver to support
	  corner vote for APC power rail. The driver takes PTE process voltage
	  suggestions in efuse as initial settings. It converts corner vote
	  to voltage value before writing to a voltage regulator API, such as
	  that provided by spm-regulator driver.

config WALL_CLK
	tristate "Wall Clock hardware block simulation"
	depends on ARCH_APQ8064
	help
	 This driver simulates the wall-clock hardware block on fsm8064_ep
	 femto emulation platform. This block will be used to provide
	 clock information to the LTE Layer 2 module running on the hexagon
	 processor.

config WALL_CLK_SYSFS
	tristate "Wall Clock SysFS Support"
	depends on SYSFS && WALL_CLK
	help
	 Support the wallclk directory in sysfs filesystem to enable the
	 wall clock simulation and read the current SFN.


config KRAIT_REGULATOR
	bool "Support Kraits powered via ganged regulators in the pmic"
	help
	 Certain MSMs have the Krait CPUs powered via a single supply
	 line from the PMIC. This supply line is powered by multiple
	 regulators running in ganged mode inside the PMIC. Enable
	 this option to support such configurations.
