# @brief Script providing the variant of the low memory killer implementation

# We look at the relevant section of the lowmem_shrink function here. This
# pattern is sufficient to distinguish between the known variants without
# introducing too many false positives for new variants. I.e. we can spot the
# lines that matter for the other_file calculation. In some cases the
# lowmemorykiller uses only the other_file calculation instead of max(free,
# file) - in the cases we've seen this is OK with the balloon policy, since the
# free term isn't really significant when we get into low memory states anyway.
