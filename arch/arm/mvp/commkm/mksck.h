/**

 *
 * @brief The monitor-kernel socket interface definitions.
 *
 * The monitor kernel socket interface was created for (what the name
 * says) communications between the monitor and host processes. On the
 * monitor side a special API is introduced, see mksck_vmm.h. On the
 * host side the API is the standard Berkeley socket interface. Host
 * process to host process or monitor to monitor communication is not
 * supported.
 *
 * A generic address consists of two 16 bit fields: the vm id and the
 * port id.  Both hosts (vmx) and monitors (vmm) get their vm id
 * automatically.  The host vm id is assigned at the time the host
 * process opens the mvpkm file descriptor, while the monitor vm id is
 * assigned when the vmx.c:SetupWorldSwitchPage() calls
 * Mvpkm_SetupIds(). As a vmx may create multiple monitors to service
 * an MP guest, a vmx vm id may be associated with multiple monitor vm
 * ids. A monitor id, however, has a single associated vmx host id,
 * the id of its canonical vmx.
 *
 * Sockets on the host get their addresses either by explicit user
 * call (the bind command) or implicitly by (issuing a send command
 * first). At an explicit bind the user may omit one or both fields by
 * providing MKSCK_VMID_UNDEF/MKSCK_PORT_UNDEF respectively. An
 * implicit bind behaves as if both fields were omitted in an explicit
 * bind. The default value of the vmid field is the vmid computed from
 * the thread group id while that of a port is a new number. It is not
 * invalid to bind a host process socket with a vm id different from
 * the vmid computed from the tgid.
 *
 * Sockets of the monitor are automatically assigned a vmid, that of their
 * monitor, at the time of their creation. The port id can be assigned by the
 * user or left to the implementation to assign an unused one (by specifying
 * MKSCK_PORT_UNDEF at @ref Mksck_Open).
 *
 * Host unconnected sockets may receive from any monitor sender, may send to any
 * monitor socket. A socket can be connected to a peer address, that enables the
 * use of the send command.
 *
 * One of many special predefined port (both host and monitor) is
 * MKSCK_PORT_MASTER. It is used for initialization.
 *
 * Monitor sockets have to send their peer address explicitly (by
 * Mksck_SetPeer()) or implicitly by receiving first. After the peer
 * is set, monitor sockets may send or receive only to/from their
 * peer.
