Introduction:
=============

The Qualcomm crypto engine (qce40) driver is a module that
provides common services for accessing the Qualcomm crypto device.
Currently, the two main clients of qce40 are
-qcrypto driver (module provided for accessing CE HW by kernel space apps)
-qcedev driver (module provided for accessing CE HW by user space apps)
This module provides the same interface to the clients as does qce.c and is
based off qce.c.  Following are the updates from qce.c
- Add support for AES XTS mode
- Add support for CMAC mode
- Add support for AES CCM mode
- Add support for  SHA1/SHA256 HMAC
- Read HASH/MAC information directly from CE hardware registers instead of
  using datamover.

The crypto engine (qce40) module is a client to the DMA driver for the Qualcomm
DMA device - Application Data Mover (ADM). ADM is used to provide the DMA
transfer capability between Qualcomm crypto device hardware and DDR memory
for crypto operations.

===============
IMPORTANT NOTE:
===============
(1) The CE hardware can be accessed either from user space OR kernel space,
    at one time. Both user space and kernel space clients cannot access the
    qce driver (and the CE hardware) at the same time.
	- If your device has user space apps that needs to access the crypto
	  hardware, make sure to have the qcrypto module disabled/unloaded.
	  This will result in the kernel space apps to use the registered
	  software implementation of the crypto algorithms.
	- If your device has kernel space apps that needs to access the
	  crypto hardware, make sure to have qcedev module disabled/unloaded
	  and implement your user space application to use the software
	  implemenation (ex: openssl/crypto) of the crypto algorithms.

(2) If your device has Playready(Windows Media DRM) application enabled and
    uses the qcedev module to access the crypto hardware accelarator,
    please be informed that for performance reasons, the CE hardware will need
    to be dedicated to playready application.  Any other user space application
    should be implemented to use the software implemenation (ex: openssl/crypto)
    of the crypto algorithms.


Hardware description:
=====================

Qualcomm Crypto HW device family provides a series of algorithms implemented
in the device hardware.

Crypto 2 hardware provides hashing - SHA-1, SHA-256, ciphering - DES, 3DES, AES
algorithms, and concurrent operations of hashing and ciphering.

In addition to those functions provided by Crypto 2 HW, Crypto 3 HW provides
fast AES algorithms.

In addition to those functions provided by Crypto 3 HW, Crypto 3E provides
HMAC-SHA1 hashing algorithm, and Over The Air (OTA) f8/f9 algorithms as
defined by the 3GPP forum.


Software description
====================

The crypto device is defined as a platform device. The driver is
independent of the platform. The driver supports multiple instances of
crypto HW.
All the platform specific parameters are defined in the board init
file, eg. arch/arm/mach-msm/board-msm8960.c for MSM8960.

The qce40 driver provide the common services of HW crypto
access to the two drivers as listed above (qcedev, qcrypto. It sets up
the crypto HW device for the operation, then it requests ADM driver for
the DMA of the crypto operation.

Two ADM channels and two command lists (one command list for each
channel) are involved in an operation.

The setting up of the command lists and the procedure of the operation
of the crypto device are described in the following sections.

The command lists contains a single command. For the first DMA channel it
is set up as follows:

  The command  is for the DMA transfer from DDR memory to the
  crypto device to input data to crypto device. The dst crci of the command
  is set for crci-in for this crypto device.

The command list for the second DMA channel is set up as follows:

  One command to DMA data from crypto device to DDR memory for encryption or
  decryption output from crypto device.

To accomplish ciphering and authentication concurrent operations, the driver
performs the following steps:
    (a). set up HW crypto device
    (b). hit the crypto go register.
    (c). issue the DMA command of first channel to the ADM driver,
    (d). issue the DMA command of 2nd channel to the ADM driver.

SHA1/SHA256 is an authentication/integrity hash algorithm. To accomplish
hash operation (or any authentication only algorithm), 2nd DMA channel is
not required. Only steps (a) to (c) are performed.

At the completion of the DMA operation (for (c) and (d)) ADM driver
invokes the callback registered to the DMA driver. This signifies the end of
the DMA operation(s). The driver reads the status and other information from
the CE hardware register.  For HASH functions (SHA1/SHA256, HMAC, CMAC and
CCM) were the MAC/HASH information is read off hardware registers.

[ NOTE: This is different from what is done in the qce module that support
CE3.x hardware.  In CE4.0 there is not CRCI_HASH and hence we cannot rely
on the data mover to populate the HMAC/SHA information.  This information
is acquired fromte h ahrdware by reading directly from some registers that
hold this information ]

The driver than nvokes the callback to the qce driver client.
This signal the completion and the results of the DMA along with the status of
the CE hardware to the qce40 driver client. This completes a crypto operation.

In the qce40 driver initialization, memory for the two command lists, descriptor
lists for each crypto device are allocated out of coherent memory, using Linux
DMA API. The driver pre-configures most of the two ADM command lists
in the initialization. During each crypto operation, minimal set up is required.
src_dscr or/and dst_dscr descriptor list of the ADM command are populated
from the information obtained from the corresponding data structure. eg: for
AEAD request, the following data structure provides the information:

    struct aead_request *req
      ......
    req->assoc
    req->src
    req->dst

The DMA address of a scatter list will be retrieved and set up in the
descriptor list of an ADM command.

Power Management

  none


Interface:
==========

The interface is defined in kernel/drivers/crypto/msm/inc/qce.h

The clients qcrypto, qcedev drivers are the clients using
the interfaces.

The following services are provided by the qce driver -

     qce_open(), qce_close(), qce_ablk_cipher_req(),
     qce_hw_support(), qce_process_sha_req()

  qce_open() is the first request from the client, ex. Qualcomm crypto
  driver (qcedev, qcrypto), to open a crypto engine. It is normally
  called at the probe function of the client for a device. During the
  probe,
  - ADM command list structure will be set up
  - Crypto device will be initialized.
  - Resource associated with the crypto engine is retrieved by doing
    platform_get_resource() or platform_get_resource_byname().

 The resources for a device are
    - crci-in, crci-out, crci-hash-done
    - two DMA channel IDs, one for encryption and decryption input, one for
      output.
    - base address of the HW crypto device.

  qce_close() is the last request from the client. Normally, it is
  called from the remove function of the client.

  qce_hw_support() allows the client to query what is supported
  by the crypto engine hardware.

  qce_ablk_cipher_req() provides ciphering service to the client.
  qce_process_sha_req() provides hashing service to the client.
  qce_aead_req() provides aead service to the client.


Module parameters:
