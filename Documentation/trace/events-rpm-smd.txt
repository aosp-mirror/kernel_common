Subsystem Trace Points: rpm_smd

The rpm-smd tracing system captures the events related to sending/receiving
messages to/from RPM hardware. The tracing system adds the following events to
capture the transactions with the RPM driver.

1) RPM send message
===================
rpm_send_message: ctx:%s set:%s rsc_type:0%x(%s),rsc_id:i0x%x, id:%u

The event captures the parameters of the message that was sent to the RPM.

The 'ctx' parameters takes one of the following string constants to indicate
if the request was made in atomic/non-atomic context.
 . "sleep" - non-atomic context
 . "noslp" - atomic context

The 'set' parameter takes one of the following string values to indicate if
the message affects active or sleep set value of the resource
 . "act" - active set configuraion
 . "slp" - sleep set configuration

The 'rsc_type' and 'rsc_id' identify the resource whose parametes is being
modified. The 4 bytes string equivalent of the resource type is also displayed
for easier identification of resources.

The 'id' parameter is the id that RPM uses to acknowledge the receipt of the
message in its ACK message


2) RPM ack message
=================
rpm_ack_recd: ctx:%s id:%u

The event captures the acknowledgement messages received from the RPM after
successfully send a message request.

The 'ctx' parameter has the same string constants referred to the "RPM Send
Message"

The 'id' parameter is the id that RPM uses to acknowledge the receipt of the
message in its ACK message
