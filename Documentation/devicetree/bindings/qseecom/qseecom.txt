* QSEECOM (Qualcomm Secure Execution Environment Communicator)

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "qcom,qseecom"
- reg : should contain memory region address reserved for loading secure apps.
- qcom,disk-encrypt-pipe-pair : indicates what CE HW pipe pair is used for disk encryption
- qcom,file-encrypt-pipe-pair : indicates what CE HW pipe pair is used for file encryption
- qcom,hlos-ce-hw-instance : indicates what CE HW is used by HLOS crypto driver
- qcom,qsee-ce-hw-instance : indicates what CE HW is used by secure domain (TZ) crypto driver
- qcom, msm_bus,name: Should be "qseecom-noc"
- qcom, msm_bus,num_cases: Depends on the use cases for bus scaling
- qcom, msm_bus,num_paths: The paths for source and destination ports
- qcom, msm_bus,vectors: Vectors for bus topology.

Optional properties:
  - qcom,support-bus-scaling : indicates if driver support scaling the bus for crypto operation.
  - qcom,support-fde : indicates if driver support key managing for full disk encryption feature.
  - qcom,support-pfe : indicates if driver support key managing for per file encryption feature.
