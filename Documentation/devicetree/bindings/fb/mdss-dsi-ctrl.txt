Qualcomm mdss-dsi-ctrl

mdss-dsi-ctrl is a dsi controller device which supports host controllers that
are compatable with MIPI display serial interface specification.

Required properties:
- compatible:				Must be "qcom,mdss-dsi-ctrl"
- cell-index:				Specifies the controller used among the two controllers.
- reg: 					Base address and length of the different register
					regions(s) required for DSI device functionality.
- reg-names: 				A list of strings that map in order to the list of regs.
					"dsi_ctrl" - MDSS DSI controller register region
					"dsi_phy" - MDSS DSI PHY register region
					"mmss_misc_phys" - Register region for MMSS DSI clamps
- vdd-supply:				Phandle for vdd regulator device node.
- vddio-supply:				Phandle for vdd-io regulator device node.
- vdda-supply:				Phandle for vreg regulator device node.
- qcom,mdss-fb-map:			pHandle that specifies the framebuffer to which the
					interface is mapped.
- qcom,mdss-mdp:			pHandle that specifies the mdss-mdp device.
- qcom,platform-regulator-settings:	An array of length 7 that specifies the PHY
					regulator settings.
- qcom,platform-strength-ctrl:		An array of length 2 that specifies the PHY
					strengthCtrl settings.
- qcom,platform-bist-ctrl:		An array of length 6 that specifies the PHY
					BIST ctrl settings.
- qcom,platform-lane-config:		An array of length 45 that specifies the PHY
					lane configuration settings.
- qcom,dsi-pref-prim-pan:		phandle that specifies the primary panel to be used
					with the controller.

Optional properties:
- label:		        	A string used to describe the controller used.

- qcom,platform-supply-entry<1..n>:	A node that lists the elements of the supply. There
					can be more than one instance of this binding,
					in which case the entry would be appended with
					the supply entry index.
					e.g. qcom,platform-supply-entry1
					-- qcom,supply-name: name of the supply (vdd/vdda/vddio)
					-- qcom,supply-min-voltage: minimum voltage level (uV)
					-- qcom,supply-max-voltage: maximum voltage level (uV)
					-- qcom,supply-enable-load: load drawn (uA) from enabled supply
					-- qcom,supply-disable-load: load drawn (uA) from disabled supply
					-- qcom,supply-pre-on-sleep: time to sleep (ms) before turning on
					-- qcom,supply-post-on-sleep: time to sleep (ms) after turning on
					-- qcom,supply-pre-off-sleep: time to sleep (ms) before turning off
					-- qcom,supply-post-off-sleep: time to sleep (ms) after turning off
- qcom,platform-enable-gpio:		Specifies the panel lcd/display enable gpio.
- qcom,platform-reset-gpio:		Specifies the panel reset gpio.
- qcom,platform-te-gpio:		Specifies the gpio used for TE.
- qcom,platform-mode-gpio:		Select video/command mode of panel through gpio when it supports
					both modes.
