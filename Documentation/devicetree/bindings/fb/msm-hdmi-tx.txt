* Qualcomm HDMI Tx

Required properties:
- cell-index: hdmi tx controller index
- compatible: must be "qcom,hdmi-tx"
- reg: offset and length of the register regions(s) for the device.
- reg-names: a list of strings that map in order to the list of regs.

- hpd-gdsc-supply: phandle to the mdss gdsc regulator device tree node.
- hpd-5v-supply: phandle to the 5V regulator device tree node.
- core-vdda-supply: phandle to the HDMI vdda regulator device tree node.
- core-vcc-supply: phandle to the HDMI vcc regulator device tree node.
- qcom,hdmi-tx-supply-names: a list of strings that map in order
  to the list of supplies.
- qcom,hdmi-tx-min-voltage-level: specifies minimum voltage level
  of supply(ies) mentioned above.
- qcom,hdmi-tx-max-voltage-level: specifies maximum voltage level
  of supply(ies) mentioned above.
- qcom,hdmi-tx-peak-current: specifies the peak current that will be
  drawn from the supply(ies) mentioned above.

- qcom,hdmi-tx-cec: gpio for Consumer Electronics Control (cec) line.
- qcom,hdmi-tx-ddc-clk: gpio for Display Data Channel (ddc) clock line.
- qcom,hdmi-tx-ddc-data: gpio for ddc data line.
- qcom,hdmi-tx-hpd: gpio required for HDMI hot-plug detect.

Optional properties:
- qcom,hdmi-tx-mux-sel: gpio required to toggle HDMI output between
  docking station, type A, and liquid device, type D, ports. Required
  property for liquid devices.
- qcom,hdmi-tx-ddc-mux-sel: gpio for ddc mux select.
- qcom,hdmi-tx-mux-en: gpio required to enable mux for HDMI output
  on liquid devices. Required property for liquid devices.

[Optional child nodes]: These nodes are for devices which are
dependent on HDMI Tx controller. If HDMI Tx controller is disabled then
these devices will be disabled as well. Ex. HDMI Audio Codec device.

- qcom,msm-hdmi-audio-rx: Node for HDMI audio codec.
Required properties:
- compatible : "msm-hdmi-audio-codec-rx";
