Atmel AT91 device tree bindings.
================================

PIT Timer required properties:
- compatible: Should be "atmel,at91sam9260-pit"
- reg: Should contain registers location and length
- interrupts: Should contain interrupt for the PIT which is the IRQ line
  shared across all System Controller members.

TC/TCLIB Timer required properties:
- compatible: Should be "atmel,<chip>-pit".
  <chip> can be "at91rm9200" or "at91sam9x5"
- reg: Should contain registers location and length
- interrupts: Should contain all interrupts for the TC block
  Note that you can specify several interrupt cells if the TC
  block has one interrupt per channel.

Examples:

One interrupt per TC block:
	tcb0: timer@fff7c000 {
		compatible = "atmel,at91rm9200-tcb";
		reg = <0xfff7c000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <18 4>;
	};

One interrupt per TC channel in a TC block:
	tcb1: timer@fffdc000 {
		compatible = "atmel,at91rm9200-tcb";
		reg = <0xfffdc000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <26 4 27 4 28 4>;
	};

RSTC Reset Controller required properties:
- compatible: Should be "atmel,<chip>-rstc".
  <chip> can be "at91sam9260" or "at91sam9g45"
- reg: Should contain registers location and length

Example:

	rstc@fffffd00 {
		compatible = "atmel,at91sam9260-rstc";
		reg = <0xfffffd00 0x10>;
	};

RAMC SDRAM/DDR Controller required properties:
- compatible: Should be "atmel,at91sam9260-sdramc",
			"atmel,at91sam9g45-ddramc",
- reg: Should contain registers location and length
  For at91sam9263 and at91sam9g45 you must specify 2 entries.

Examples:

	ramc0: ramc@ffffe800 {
		compatible = "atmel,at91sam9g45-ddramc";
		reg = <0xffffe800 0x200>;
	};

	ramc0: ramc@ffffe400 {
		compatible = "atmel,at91sam9g45-ddramc";
		reg = <0xffffe400 0x200
		       0xffffe600 0x200>;
	};

SHDWC Shutdown Controller

required properties:
- compatible: Should be "atmel,<chip>-shdwc".
  <chip> can be "at91sam9260", "at91sam9rl" or "at91sam9x5".
- reg: Should contain registers location and length

optional properties:
- atmel,wakeup-mode: String, operation mode of the wakeup mode.
  Supported values are: "none", "high", "low", "any".
- atmel,wakeup-counter: Counter on Wake-up 0 (between 0x0 and 0xf).

optional at91sam9260 properties:
- atmel,wakeup-rtt-timer: boolean to enable Real-time Timer Wake-up.

optional at91sam9rl properties:
- atmel,wakeup-rtc-timer: boolean to enable Real-time Clock Wake-up.
- atmel,wakeup-rtt-timer: boolean to enable Real-time Timer Wake-up.

optional at91sam9x5 properties:
- atmel,wakeup-rtc-timer: boolean to enable Real-time Clock Wake-up.

Example:

	rstc@fffffd00 {
		compatible = "atmel,at91sam9260-rstc";
		reg = <0xfffffd00 0x10>;
	};
