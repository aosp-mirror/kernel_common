Memory Hole

The msm_mem_hole module exists for the express purpose of removing
memory via the msm memory-remove mechanism (see
memory-reserve.txt). Compiling this module into a kernel is
essentially the means by which any nodes in the device tree with
compatible = "qcom,msm-mem-hole" will be "activated", thus providing a
convenient mechanism for enabling/disabling memory removal
(qcom,memory-*).


Required properties

- compatible: "qcom,msm-mem-hole"

	qcom,msm-mem-hole {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-mem-hole";
		qcom,memblock-remove = <0x8100000 0x7e00000>; /* Address and Size of Hole */
	};
