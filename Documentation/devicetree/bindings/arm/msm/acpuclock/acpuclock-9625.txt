* Qualcomm Application CPU clock driver

acpuclock-9625 is the application cpu clock driver for MDM9625. It is used for
cpu frequency scaling, voltage scaling and bus bandwidth scaling.

Required properties:
- compatible: "qcom,acpuclk-9625"
- reg: offset and length of the register sets for the acpuclock controller
- reg-names: name of the bases for the above registers. "rcg_base", "pwr_base"
	     are expected.
- a5_cpu-supply: regulator to supply a5 cpu
- a5_mem-supply: regulator to supply a5 l2 cache

Example:
        qcom,acpuclk@f9010000 {
                compatible = "qcom,acpuclk-9625";
                reg = <0xf9010008 0x10>,
                      <0xf9008004 0x4>;
                reg-names = "rcg_base", "pwr_base";
                a5_cpu-supply = <&pm8019_l10_corner_ao>;
                a5_mem-supply = <&pm8019_l12_ao>;
        };
