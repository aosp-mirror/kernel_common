* Qualcomm Application CPU clock device

acpuclock-a7 selects the clock source used by the cpus and l2 cache. It
can be configured to divide the clock source by any value in [1, 16] in
half-integer increments.

Required properties:
- compatible: "qcom,acpuclk-a7"
- reg: offset and length of the register sets for the acpuclock controller
- reg-names: name of the bases for the above registers. "rcg_base"
	     is expected.
- a7_cpu-supply: regulator to supply a7 cpu

Optional properties:
- reg-names: "pte_efuse". Registers indicate maximum cpu speed.

Example:
	qcom,acpuclk@f9011050 {
		compatible = "qcom,acpuclk-a7";
		reg = <0xf9011050 0x8>;
		reg-names = "rcg_base";
		a7_cpu-supply = <&pm8026_s2>;
	};
