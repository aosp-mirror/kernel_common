Required properties:
- compatible : should be "qcom,bam_dmux"
- reg : the location and size of the BAM hardware
- interrupts : the BAM hardware to apps processor interrupt line

Optional properties:
-qcom,satellite-mode: the hardware needs to be configured in satellite mode
-qcom,rx-ring-size: the size of the receive ring buffer pool, default is 32

Example:

	qcom,bam_dmux@fc834000 {
		compatible = "qcom,bam_dmux";
		reg = <0xfc834000 0x7000>;
		interrupts = <0 29 1>;
		qcom,satellite-mode;
		qcom,rx-ring-size = <64>;
	};
