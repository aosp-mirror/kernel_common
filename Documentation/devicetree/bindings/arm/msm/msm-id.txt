* MSM-ID

The qcom,msm-id entry specifies the MSM chipset, platform and hardware revision.
It can optionally be an array of these to indicate multiple hardware that use
the same device tree.  It is expected that the bootloader will use this
information at boot-up to decide which device tree to use when given multiple
device trees, some of which may not be compatible with the actual hardware.  It
is the bootloader's responsibility to pass the correct device tree to the kernel.

Format:

It is expected that the qcom,msm-id entry be at the top level of the device
tree structure.  The format can take one of the two forms below:

   qcom,msm-id = <chipset_id, platform_id, rev_id> [, <c2, p2, r2> ...]
   qcom,msm-id = <chipset_id, rev_id> [, <c2, r2> ...]

If the second format is used one must also define the board-id.

Example:
   qcom,msm-id = <126 15 0>;

   qcom,board-id= <15 2>;
   qcom,msm-id = <126 0>;
