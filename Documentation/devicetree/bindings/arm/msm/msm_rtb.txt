Register Trace Buffer (RTB)

The RTB is used to log discrete events in the system in an uncached buffer that
can be post processed from RAM dumps. The RTB must reserve memory using
the msm specific memory reservation bindings (see
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/memory-reserve.txt).

Required properties

- compatible: "qcom,msm-rtb"
- qcom,memory-reservation-size: size of reserved memory for the RTB buffer
- qcom,memory-reservation-type: type of memory to be reserved
(see memory-reserve.txt for information about memory reservations)

Example:

	qcom,msm-rtb {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-rtb";
		qcom,memory-reservation-type = "EBI1";
		qcom,memory-reservation-size = <0x100000>; /* 1M EBI1 buffer */
	};
