* Qualcomm MSM Watchdog

Watchdog timer is configured with a bark and a bite time.
if the watchdog is not "pet" at regular intervals, the system
is assumed to have become non responsive and needs to be reset.
A warning in the form of a bark timeout leads to a bark interrupt
and a kernel panic. if the watchdog timer is still not reset,
a bite timeout occurs, which is an interrupt in the secure mode,
which leads to a reset of the SOC via the secure watchdog. The
driver needs the petting time, and the bark timeout to be programmed
into the watchdog, as well as the bark and bite irqs.

The device tree parameters for the watchdog are:

Required properties:

- compatible : "qcom,msm-watchdog"
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the watchdog block.
- interrupts : should contain bark and bite irq numbers
- qcom,pet-time : Non zero time interval at which watchdog should be pet in ms.
- qcom,bark-time : Non zero timeout value for a watchdog bark in ms.

Optional properties:

- qcom,ipi-ping : (boolean) send keep alive ping to other cpus if present

Example:

	qcom,wdt@f9017000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-watchdog";
		reg = <0xf9017000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 3 0>, <0 4 0>;
		qcom,bark-time = <11000>;
		qcom,pet-time = <10000>;
		qcom,ipi-ping;
	};
