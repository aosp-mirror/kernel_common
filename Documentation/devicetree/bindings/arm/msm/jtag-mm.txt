* JTAG-MM

The jtag-mm entry specifies the memory mapped addresses for the debug and ETM
registers. The jtag-mm driver uses these to save and restore the registers
using memory mapped access during power collapse so as to retain their state
accross power collapse. This is necessary in case cp14 access to the registers
is not permitted.

Required Properties:
compatible: component name used for driver matching, should be "qcom,jtag-mm"
reg: physical base address and length of the register set
reg-names: should be "etm-base" for etm register set and "debug-base" for debug
	register set.

Example:
jtag_mm: jtagmm@fc332000 {
	compatible = "qcom,jtag-mm";
	reg = <0xfc332000 0x1000>,
		<0xfc333000 0x1000>;
	reg-names = "etm-base","debug-base";
	};
