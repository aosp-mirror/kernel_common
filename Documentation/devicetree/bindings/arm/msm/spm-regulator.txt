Qualcomm SPM Regulators

spm-regulator is a regulator device which supports PMIC processor supply
regulators via the SPM module.

Required properties:
- compatible:      Must be "qcom,spm-regulator"
- reg:             Specifies the SPMI address and size for this regulator device
- regulator-name:  A string used as a descriptive name for the regulator

Required structure:
- A qcom,spm-regulator node must be a child of an SPMI node that has specified
	the spmi-slave-container property

Optional properties:
- qcom,mode:       A string which specifies the mode to use for the regulator.
		    Supported values are "pwm" and "auto".  PWM mode is more
		    robust, but draws more current than auto mode.  If this
		    property is not specified, then the regulator will remain
		    in whatever mode hardware or bootloaders set it to.

All properties specified within the core regulator framework can also be used.
These bindings can be found in regulator.txt.

Example:
	qcom,spmi@fc4c0000 {

		qcom,pm8226@1 {
			spmi-slave-container;

			spm-regulator@1700 {
				compatible = "qcom,spm-regulator";
				regulator-name = "8226_s2";
				reg = <0x1700 0x100>;
				regulator-min-microvolt = <900000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1275000>;
			};
		};
	};
