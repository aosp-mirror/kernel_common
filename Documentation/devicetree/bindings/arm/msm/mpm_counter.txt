* MSM MPM sleep counter (mpm-v2)

The MPM provides a timetick that starts when the device is powered up and
is not reset by any of the boot loaders or the HLOS. The MPM timetick counter
driver provides an api to get this value.

The required nodes for the MPM timetick counter driver are:

- compatible: "qcom,mpm2-sleep-counter"
- reg: Specifies the physical address of the timetick count register.
- clock-frequency: the physical counter frequency.

Example:
	qcom,mpm2-sleep-counter@fc4a3000 {
		compatible = "qcom,mpm2-sleep-counter";
		reg = <0xfc4a3000 0x1000>;
		clock-frequency = <32768>;
	};
