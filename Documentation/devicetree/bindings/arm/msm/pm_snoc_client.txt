* MSM PM SNOC client

MSM PM SNOC client device is used to setup a bus request for 100 Mhz for the
SNOC bus when the Apps cores are active. This bus request helps mitigate the
exit latency from power collapse in cases where there aren't any active bus
requests for SNOC.

This device is dependent on the pm-8x60 device, which configures the low power
mode of respective cores.

The required properties of this device are:

- compatible: qcom,pm-snoc-client
- qcom,msm-bus,name:            String representing the client-name
- qcom,msm-bus,num-cases:       Total number of usecases
- qcom,msm-bus,active-only:     Boolean context flag for requests in active or
                                dual (active & sleep) contex
- qcom,msm-bus,num-paths:       Total number of master-slave pairs
- qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps:    Arrays of unsigned integers representing:
                                master-id, slave-id, arbitrated bandwidth
                                in KBps, instantaneous bandwidth in KBps


Example:
	qcom,pm-snoc-client {
		compatible = "qcom,pm-snoc-client";
		qcom,msm-bus,name = "ocimem_snoc";
		qcom,msm-bus,num-cases = <2>;
		qcom,msm-bus,active-only;
		qcom,msm-bus,num-paths = <1>;
		qcom,msm-bus,vectors =
			<22 512 0 0>,
			<22 512 320000 3200000>;
	};
