Qualcomm Parallel Interface controller (QPIC) for NAND devices

Required properties:
- compatible : "qcom,msm-nand".
- reg : should specify QPIC NANDc and BAM physical address range.
- reg-names : should specify relevant names to each reg property defined.
- interrupts : should specify QPIC/BAM interrupt numbers.
- interrupt-names : should specify relevant names to each interrupts property
  defined.

MTD flash partition layout for NAND devices -

Each partition is represented as a sub-node of the qcom,mtd-partitions device.
Each node's name represents the name of the corresponding partition.

This is now completely optional as the partition information is avaialble from
bootloader.

Optional properties:
- reg : The partition offset and size
- label : The label / name for this partition.
- read-only: This parameter, if present, indicates that this partition
  should only be mounted read-only.

Examples:

	qcom,nand@f9af0000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-nand";
		reg = <0xf9af0000 0x1000>,
		      <0xf9ac4000 0x8000>;
		reg-names = "nand_phys",
			    "bam_phys";
		interrupts = <0 279 0>;
		interrupt-names = "bam_irq";
	};

       qcom,mtd-partitions {
	       #address-cells = <1>;
	       #size-cells = <1>;
               partition@0 {
                       label = "boot";
                       reg = <0x0 0x1000>;
		       read-only;
               };
               partition@20000 {
                       label = "userdata";
                       reg = <0x20000 0x1000>;
               };
               partition@40000 {
                       label = "system";
                       reg = <0x40000 0x1000>;
               };
       };
