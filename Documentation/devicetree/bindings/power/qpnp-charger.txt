Qualcomm QPNP Charger

The charger supports the switch mode battery charger and boost (SMBB)
peripherals on Qualcomm PMIC chips.

There are seven different peripherals adding the following functionality.
Each of these peripherals are implemented as subnodes in the example at the
end of this file.

- qcom,chgr:		Supports charging control and status
			reporting.
- qcom,bat-if:		Battery status reporting such as presence,
			temperature reporting and voltage collapse
			protection.
- qcom,buck:		Charger buck configuration and status
			reporting with regards to several regulation
			loops such as vdd, ibat etc.
- qcom,usb-chgpth:	USB charge path detection and input current
			limiting configuration.
- qcom,dc-chgpth:	DC charge path detection and input current
			limiting configuration.
- qcom,chg-misc:	Miscellaneous features such as buck frequency
			settings, comparator override features etc.

Parent node required properties:
- qcom,vddmax-mv:			Target voltage of battery in mV.
- qcom,vddsafe-mv:			Maximum Vdd voltage in mV.
- qcom,vinmin-mv:			Minimum input voltage in mV.
- qcom,ibatmax-ma:			Maximum battery charge current in mA
- qcom,ibatsafe-ma:			Safety battery current setting
- qcom,thermal-mitigation:		Array of ibatmax values for different
					system thermal mitigation level.

Parent node optional properties:
- qcom,ibatterm-ma:			Current at which charging is terminated when
					the analog end of charge option is selected.
- qcom,maxinput-usb-ma:			Maximum input current USB.
- qcom,maxinput-dc-ma:			Maximum input current DC.
- qcom,vbatdet-delta-mv:		Battery charging resume delta.
- qcom,vbatweak-mv:			Weak battery voltage threshold in mV, above which
					fast charging can start. The supported voltage range is
					from 2100mV to 3600mV with a step size of 100mV.
- qcom,charging-disabled:		Set this property to disable charging
					by default. This can then be overriden
					writing the the module parameter
					"charging_disabled".
- qcom,duty-cycle-100p:			Set this property to enable the 100% duty
					cycle feature.
- qcom,use-default-batt-values:		Set this flag to force reporting of
					battery temperature of 250 decidegree
					Celsius, state of charge to be 50%
					and disable charging.
- qcom,warm-bat-decidegc:		Warm battery temperature in decidegC.
- qcom,cool-bat-decidegc:		Cool battery temperature in decidegC.
					Note that if both warm and cool battery
					temperatures are set, the corresponding
					ibatmax and bat-mv properties are
					required to be set.
- qcom,ibatmax-cool-ma:			Maximum cool battery charge current.
- qcom,ibatmax-warm-ma:			Maximum warm battery charge current.
- qcom,warm-bat-mv:			Warm temperature battery target voltage.
- qcom,cool-bat-mv:			Cool temperature battery target voltage.
- qcom,tchg-mins:			Maximum total software initialized charge time.
- qcom,bpd-detection:			Select a battery presence detection scheme by
					specifying either "bpd_thm", "bpd_id" or
					"bpd_thm_id". "bpd_thm" selects the temperature
					pin, "bpd_id" uses the id pin for battery presence
					detection, "bpd_thm_id" selects both.
					If the property is not set, the temperatue pin will
					be used.
- qcom,btc-disabled:			If flag is set battery hot and cold monitoring is
					disabled in hardware. This monitoring is turned on
					by default.
- qcom,batt-hot-percent:		Specify a supported hot threshold percentage.
					Supported thresholds: 25% and 35%. If none is specified
					hardware defaults will be used.
- qcom,batt-cold-percent:		Specify a supported cold threshold percentage.
					Supported thresholds: 70% and 80%. If none is specified
					hardware defaults will be used.
- otg-parent-supply			Specify a phandle to a parent supply regulator
					for the OTG regulator.
- boost-parent-supply			Specify a phandle to a parent supply regulator
					for the boost regulator.
- qcom,resume-soc			Capacity in percent at which charging should resume
					when a fully charged battery drops below this level.
- qcom,chg-vadc				Corresponding VADC device's phandle.
- qcom,pmic-revid			The phandle to the revid node of the pmic on which charger
					peripheral is present. This property is a must on PMIC chips
					that exhibit inaccuracies in battery current readings. This
					phandle is used to check the version of the PMIC and apply
					necessary software workarounds.
- qcom,ovp-monitor-en			The ovp is enabled on hw by default. If this flag is
					set, the charger ovp status is monitored in software.
- qcom,ext-ovp-present			Indicates if an external OVP exists which reduces the
					overall input resistance of the charge path.
- qcom,ibat-calibration-enabled		Indicates if ibat calibration is enabled. This is
					required for devices which have a ibat trim error
					causing ibatmax to go out of spec.
- qcom,power-stage-reduced		Indicates if power stage workaround is enabled. This work
					around reduces the power stage segments while charging
					under high load during low battery voltages. It's for
					improving IADC accuracy while board has a bad layout.
- qcom,use-external-rsense		A boolean that controls whether BMS will use
					an external sensor resistor instead of the default
					RDS of the batfet.
- qcom,vbatdet-maxerr-mv		This property in mV is a hystersis value for the charge
					resume voltage property qcom,vbatdet-delta-mv. If this
					property is not defined it defaults to 50 mV.
- qcom,parallel-ovp-mode		When this option is enabled, it allows charging through both
					DC and USB OVP FETs. Please note that this should only
					be enabled in board designs with PM8941 which have DC_IN
					and USB_IN connected via a short.
 - qcom,ext-ovp-isns-enable-gpio	External OVP enable GPIO.
 - qcom,ext-ovp-isns-r-ohm			External ISNS OVP resistance in ohm.

Sub node required structure:
- A qcom,chg node must be a child of an SPMI node that has specified
	the spmi-dev-container property. Each subnode reflects
	a hardware peripheral which adds a unique set of features
	to the collective charging device. For example USB detection
	and the battery interface are each seperate peripherals and
	each should be their own subnode.
- qcom,chg-adc_tm			Corresponding ADC TM device's phandle to set recurring
					measurements and receive notification for batt_therm.

Sub node required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,qpnp-charger".
- reg:			Specifies the SPMI address and size for this peripheral.
- interrupts:		Specifies the interrupt associated with the peripheral.
