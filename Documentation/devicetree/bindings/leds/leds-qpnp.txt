Qualcomm QPNP Leds

QPNP (Qualcomm Plug N Play) LEDs driver is used for
controlling LEDs that are part of PMIC on Qualcomm reference
platforms. The PMIC is connected to Host processor via
SPMI bus. This driver supports various LED modules such as
Keypad backlight, WLED (white LED), RGB LED and flash LED.

Each LED module is represented as a node of "leds-qpnp". This
node will further contain the type of LED supported and its
properties.  At least one child node is required for each LED
module.  Each must have the required properties below, in addition
to the properties for the LED type, WLED, Flash, RGB and MPP.

Required properties for each child node, WLED, Flash and RGB:
- compatible		: should be "qcom,leds-qpnp"

- label			: type of led that will be used, ie "wled"
- qcom,max-current	: maximum current that the LED can sustain in mA
- linux,name		: name of the led that is used in led framework

Optional properties for each child node, WLED, Flash, MPP, RGB and KPDBL:
- qcom,in-order-command-processing : specify if user space requests leds in order
