* Universal Flash Storage (UFS) Host Controller

UFSHC nodes are defined to describe on-chip UFS host controllers.
Each UFS controller instance should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible        : compatible list, contains "jedec,ufs-1.1"
- interrupts        : <interrupt mapping for UFS host controller IRQ>
- reg               : <registers mapping>

Example:
	ufshc@0xfc598000 {
		compatible = "jedec,ufs-1.1";
		reg = <0xfc598000 0x800>;
		interrupts = <0 28 0>;
	};
