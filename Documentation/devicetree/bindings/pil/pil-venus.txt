* Qualcomm Venus Video Subsystem Peripheral Image Loader

pil-venus is a peripheral image loading (PIL) driver. It is used for loading
venus firmware images for video codec into memory and preparing the subsystem's
processor to execute code. It is also used for shutting down the processor when
it's not needed.

Required properties:
- compatible: "pil-venus"
- reg: offset and length of the register set for the device.
- reg-names: names of the bases for the above registers. "wrapper_base" and
             "vbif_base" are expected.
- vdd-supply: regulator to supply venus.
- qcom,firmware-name: Base name of the firmware image. Ex. "venus"

Example:
        qcom,venus@fdce0000 {
                compatible = "qcom,pil-venus";
                reg = <0xfdce0000 0x4000>,
                      <0xfdc80208 0x8>;
		reg-names = "wrapper_base", "vbif_base";
                vdd-supply = <&gdsc_venus>;

                qcom,firmware-name = "venus";
        };
