TI DRV2667 is a haptic controller chip. It can drive piezo haptics
and can operate in two modes - analog and digital.

Required properties:

-compatible	: should be "ti,drv2667".
-reg		: i2c address to be used.
-vdd-supply	: regulator to power the chip.
-vdd-i2c-supply	: regulator to power i2c bus.

Optional properties:

-ti,label		: Name to be registered with timedoutput class.
-ti,mode		: Mode to be supported, 0 to 3 - FIFO, RAM, WAVE and ANALOG.
-ti,wav-seq		: Wave Sequence composed of 11 bytes - wave form id,
				Header size, start upper byte, start lower byte,
				stop upper byte, stop lower byte, repeat count,
				amplitude, frequency, duration and envelope
-ti,gain		: Gain to be programmed for the chip.
-ti,idle-timeout-ms	: Idle timeout in ms to be programmed for the chip to go into
				low power mode after finishing its operation.
-ti,max-runtime-ms	: Maximum time in ms for which chip can drive haptics.

Example:
	i2c@f9967000 {
		ti-drv2667@59 {
			compatible = "ti,drv2667";
			reg = <0x59>;
			vdd-supply = <&drv2667_vreg>;
			vdd-i2c-supply = <&pm8941_s3>;
			ti,label = "vibrator";
			ti,gain = <3>;
			ti,idle-timeout-ms = <20>;
			ti,max-runtime-ms = <15000>;
			ti,mode = <2>;
			ti,wav-seq = [
				/* wave form id */
				01
				/* header size, start and stop bytes */
				05 80 06 00 09
				/* repeat, amp, freq, duration, envelope */
				01 ff 19 02 00];
		};
	};
