* avtimer

Avtimer provides an interface for clients to enable avtimer block
on qdsp6. 64 bit AVtimer exposed by qdsp6 is used for audio and video
stream synchronization during capture and playback usecases.

Required properties:
- reg : physical address and length of avtimer register
- reg-names : AVtimer register name
  Required register resource entries are:
  "avtimer_lsb_addr" : AVtimer lsb physical address
  "avtimer_msb_addr" : AVtimer msb physical address
- compatible : Must be "qcom,avtimer"

Optional properties:
- clk_div : For 8916 the clk is at 27MHz and hence ticks are to be
 divided by 27 to achive the msec value.

Example:
	qcom,avtimer {
		compatible = "qcom,avtimer";
		reg = <0xfe053008 0x4>,
			<0xfe05300c 0x4>;
		reg-names = "avtimer_lsb_addr", "avtimer_msb_addr";
		qcom,clk_div = <27>;
	};
