* qpnp-clkdiv

clkdiv configures the clock frequency of a set of outputs on the PMIC.
These clocks are typically wired through alternate functions on
gpio pins.

Required properties :
 - reg : The address and size of the peripheral. Size should be 0x1000, and the
         address may vary.
 - qcom,cxo-freq : The frequency of the cxo clock in Hz.

Optional properties :
 - qcom,cxo-div : Integer to divide the CXO clock by when constructing the
		  output frequency. Please see the definitions in
		  include/linux/qpnp-clkdiv.h to choose the appropriate value.
 - qcom,enable : 0 == disable clock output
		 1 == enable clock output.

Note: if an optional property is not specified, no device configuration will
      occur at probe time.

Client required properties :
 - <consumer name>-clk : A phandle to the corresponding divclk device. The
			      consumer name refers to the name that will be
			      passed to qpnp_clkdiv_get(), and allows for a
			      client specific name to be associated with each
			      divclk.

Clkdiv device example :

...
	pm8941_clkdiv1: clkdiv@5b00 {
		reg = <0x5b00 0x1000>;
		qcom,cxo-freq = <19200000>;
		qcom,cxo-div = <1>;
		qcom,enable = <1>;
	};

Client device example :
...
	client {
		my-clk = &pm8941_clkdiv1;
	};
