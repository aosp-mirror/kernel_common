Freescale MMA8x5x 3-Axis Orientation/Motion Detection Sensor series
(MMA8451/MMA8452/MMA8453/MMA8652/MMA8653)

The Freescale 3-Axis Orientation/Motion Detection Sensor is
connected to host processor via i2c.
The sensor can be polling for acceleration data or configure to
generates interrupts when a motion is detected.

Required properties:

 - compatible		: should be "fsl,mma8x5x"
 - reg			: i2c slave address of the device
 - vdd-supply : power supply needed to power up the device.
 - vio-supply	: power supply needed for device IO and to pullup i2c bus.
 - fsl,sensors-position	: select from 0 to 7 depends on how the sensor is
				 mounting on the board, this will decide how the 3-axis reading
				 of data will be translated to X/Y/Z axis of acceleration data.

Optional properties:
 Sensor can work on polling mode or interrupt mode, following interrupt
 is required if the sensor need to work on interrupt mode.
 - interrupt-parent	: parent of interrupt.
 - interrupts		: sensor signal interrupt to indicate new data ready or
				 a motion is detected.
 - fsl,use-interrupt	: to enable interrupt mode.
 - fsl,irq-gpio	: First irq gpio which is to provide interrupts to host, same
				 as "interrupts" node. It will also contain active low or active
				 high information.

Example:
	fsl@1c {
		compatible = "fsl,mma8x5x";
		reg = <0x1c>;
		interrupt-parent = <&msmgpio>;
		interrupts = <81 0x2>;
		vdd-supply = <&pm8110_l19>;
		vio-supply = <&pm8110_l14>;
		fsl,sensors-position = <5>;
		fsl,irq-gpio = <&msmgpio 0x81 0x02>;
		fsl,use-interrupt;
	};
