* Qualcomm Krait L1 / L2 cache dumping device
This is a virtual device that dumps the contents of L1 and L2 caches in the
event of a kernel panic or a watchdog trigger.

Required properties:
- compatible:			Should be "qcom,cache_dump"
- qcom,l1-dump-size:		Amount of memory needed for L1 dump(s), in bytes
- qcom,l2-dump-size:		Amount of memory needed for L2 dump, in bytes
- qcom,memory-reservation-size: Combined reserved memory for the dump buffers
- qcom,memory-reservation-type: Type of memory to be reserved

Optional properties:
- qcom,use-imem-dump-offset: If specified, store cache dump buffer addresses
  in IMEM rather than using the memory dump reservation table.

Example:
	qcom,cache_dump {
		compatible = "qcom,cache_dump";
		qcom,l1-dump-size = <0x100000>;
		qcom,l2-dump-size = <0x400000>;
		qcom,memory-reservation-type = "EBI1";
		qcom,memory-reservation-size = <0x500000>;
	};
