* Qualcomm MSM CAMERA FLASH

Required properties:
- cell-index : Should contain flash source index to diffentiate
    between different flash devices. These indexes represent flash devices
    for multiple sensors.
    - 0, 1, 2, 3
- compatible :
    - "qcom,camera-led-flash"
- qcom,flash-type : Should contain type flash device
    - 1 for LED flash
    - 2 for strobe flash
    - 3 for simple led flash controlled by one gpio
      This is a low cost led used for camera flash, the led is driven by
      system power, and use a transistor controlled by external pin to
      gate its on/off state.
- qcom,flash-source : Should contain array of phandles to flash source nodes.
    - pm8941_flash0 pm8941_flash1

Optional properties:
-qcom,torch-source : Should contain phandle to torch source node.
    -pm8941_torch

Example:

qcom,camera-led-flash {
	cell-index = <0>;
	compatible = "qcom,camera-led-flash";
	qcom,flash-type = <1>;
	qcom,flash-source = <&pm8941_flash0 &pm8941_flash1>;
	qcom,torch-source = <&pm8941_torch>;
};
