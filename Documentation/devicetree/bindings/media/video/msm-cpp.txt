* Qualcomm MSM CPP

Required properties:
- cell-index: cpp hardware core index
- compatible :
    - "qcom,cpp"
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device
    for the cpp operating in compatible mode.
- reg-names : should specify relevant names to each reg property defined.
  - cpp - has CPP MICRO register set.
  - cpp_vbif - has VBIF core register set used by CPP.
  - cpp_hw - has CPP hardware register set.
- interrupts : should contain the cpp interrupt.
- interrupt-names : should specify relevant names to each interrupts
  property defined.
- vdd-supply: phandle to GDSC regulator controlling VFE & CPP core.

Example:

   qcom,cpp@0xfda04000 {
       cell-index = <0>;
       compatible = "qcom,cpp";
       reg = <0xfda04000 0x100>;
             <0xfda40000 0x200>;
             <0xfd180000 0x008>;
       reg-names = "cpp", "cpp_vbif", "cpp_hw";
       interrupts = <0 49 0>;
       interrupt-names = "cpp";
       vdd-supply = <&gdsc_vfe>;
   };
