Stub Voltage Regulators

stub-regulators are place-holder regulator devices which do not impact any
hardware state.  They provide a means for consumer devices to utilize all
regulator features for testing purposes.

Required properties:
- compatible:      Must be "qcom,stub-regulator".
- regulator-name:  A string used as a descriptive name for regulator outputs.

Optional properties:
- parent-supply:     phandle to the parent supply/regulator node if one exists.
- qcom,hpm-min-load: Load current in uA which corresponds to the minimum load
			which requires the regulator to be in high power mode.
- qcom,system-load:  Load in uA present on regulator that is not captured by any
			consumer request.

All properties specified within the core regulator framework can also be used.
These bindings can be found in regulator.txt.

Example:

/ {
	pm8026_s3: regulator-s3 {
		compatible = "qcom,stub-regulator";
		regulator-name = "8026_s3";
		qcom,hpm-min-load = <100000>;
		regulator-min-microvolt = <1300000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1300000>;
	};

	pm8026_l1: regulator-l1 {
		compatible = "qcom,stub-regulator";
		regulator-name = "8026_l1";
		parent-supply = <&pm8026_s3>;
		qcom,hpm-min-load = <10000>;
		regulator-min-microvolt = <1225000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1225000>;
	};

	pm8026_l20: regulator-l20 {
		compatible = "qcom,stub-regulator";
		regulator-name = "8026_l20";
		qcom,hpm-min-load = <5000>;
		regulator-min-microvolt = <3075000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <3075000>;
	};
};
