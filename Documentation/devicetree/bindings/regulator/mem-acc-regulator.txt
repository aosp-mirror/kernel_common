Qualcomm Technologies Memory Accelerator

Memory accelerator configures the power-mode (corner) for the
accelerator.

Required properties:
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,mem-acc-regulator"
- regulator-name:		A string used to describe the regulator
- regulator-min-microvolt:	Minimum corner value as min constraint, which
				should be 1 for SVS corner
- regulator-max-microvolt:	Maximum corner value as max constraint, which
				should be 4 for SUPER_TURBO or 3 for TURBO
- qcom,corner-acc-map		Array which maps the APC (application processor)
				corner value to the accelerator corner.
				[0] maps APC SVS corner (1) to accelerator SVS corner
				[1] maps APC NOMINAL corner (2) to accelerator NOMINAL corner
				[2] maps APC TURBO corner (3) to accelerator TURBO corner

Optional properties:
- reg:				Register addresses for acc-en and acc-sel-l1 acc-sel-l2 control.
- reg-names:			Register names. Must be "acc-sel-l1", "acc-sel-l2", "acc-en".
				A given mem-acc-regulator driver must have "acc-sel-l1" or
				"acc-sel-l2" reg-names property and related register address
				property.
- qcom,acc-en-bit-pos		Array which specifies bit positions in the
				'acc-en' register. Setting these bits forces the
				the acclerator to use the corner value specified
				in the 'acc-sel-l1' and 'acc-sel-l2' register.
- qcom,acc-sel-l1-bit-pos	Array which specifies bit positions in the
				'acc-sel-l1' register. Each element in this array
				is the LSB of a 2-bit value. This 2-bit value
				specifies the corner value used by the
				accelerator for L1 cache.
- qcom,acc-sel-l2-bit-pos	Array which specifies bit positions in the
				'acc-sel-l2' register. Each element in this array
				is the LSB of a 2-bit value. This 2-bit value
				specifies the corner value used by the
				accelerator for L2 cache.
