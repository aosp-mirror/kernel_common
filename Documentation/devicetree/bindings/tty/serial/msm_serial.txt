* Qualcomm MSM UART

Required properties:
- compatible :
	- "qcom,msm-uart", and one of "qcom,msm-hsuart" or
	  "qcom,msm-lsuart".
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device
	for the hsuart operating in compatible mode, there should be a
	second pair describing the gsbi registers.
- interrupts : should contain the uart interrupt.

There are two different UART blocks used in MSM devices,
"qcom,msm-hsuart" and "qcom,msm-lsuart".  The msm-serial driver is
able to handle both of these, and matches against the "qcom,msm-uart"
as the compatibility.

The registers for the "qcom,msm-hsuart" device need to specify both
register blocks, even for the common driver.

Example:

	uart@19c400000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-hsuart", "qcom,msm-uart";
		reg = <0x19c40000 0x1000>,
		      <0x19c00000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <195>;
	};

* Qualcomm MSM HSUART

Required properties:
- compatible : one of:
	- "qcom,msm-lsuart-v14"
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts : should contain the uart interrupt.

Optional properties:
- qcom,config-gpio : Set this value if UART GPIOs need to be configured by driver.
set 4 if 4-wire UART used (for Tx, Rx, CTS, RFR GPIOs).
Set 1 if 2-wire UART used (for Tx, Rx GPIOs).
- qcom,<gpio-name>-gpio : handle to the GPIO node, see "gpios property" in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt.
"gpio-name" can be "tx", "rx", "cts" and "rfr" based on number of UART GPIOs
need to configured.
qcom,use-pm : If present, this property will cause the device to prevent system
suspend as long as the port remains open.
- Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt" for below properties:
    - qcom,msm_bus,name
    - qcom,msm_bus,num_cases
    - qcom,msm_bus,active_only
    - qcom,msm_bus,num_paths
    - qcom,msm_bus,vectors

Aliases:
An alias may optionally be used to bind the serial device to a tty device
(ttyHSLx) with a given line number. Aliases are of the form serial<n> where <n>
is an integer representing the line number to use. On systems with multiple
serial devices present it is recommended that an alias be defined for each such
device.

Example:
	aliases {
		serial0 = &uart0;       // This device will be called ttyHSL0
	};

	uart0: serial@19c400000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-lsuart-v14"
		reg = <0x19c40000 0x1000">;
		interrupts = <195>;

		qcom,config-gpio = <4>;
		qcom,tx-gpio = <&msmgpio 41 0x00>;
		qcom,rx-gpio = <&msmgpio 42 0x00>;
		qcom,cts-gpio = <&msmgpio 43 0x00>;
		qcom,rfr-gpio = <&msmgpio 44 0x00>;
		qcom,use-pm;

		qcom,msm-bus,name = "serial_uart0";
		qcom,msm-bus,num-cases = <2>;
		qcom,msm-bus,num-paths = <1>;
		qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps =
				<84 512 0 0>,
				<84 512 500 800>;
	};
