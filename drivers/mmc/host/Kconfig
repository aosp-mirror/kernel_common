	depends on ARM_AMBA
	help
	  This selects the ARM(R) AMBA(R) PrimeCell Multimedia Card
	  Interface (PL180 and PL181) support.  If you have an ARM(R)
	  platform with a Multimedia Card slot, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

	tristate "Secure Digital Host Controller Interface support"
	depends on HAS_DMA
	help
	  This selects the generic Secure Digital Host Controller Interface.
	  It is used by manufacturers such as Texas Instruments(R), Ricoh(R)
	  and Toshiba(R). Most controllers found in laptops are of this type.

	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here. You
	  also need to enable an appropriate bus interface.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_SDHCI_IO_ACCESSORS
	bool
	depends on MMC_SDHCI
	help
	  This is silent Kconfig symbol that is selected by the drivers that
	  need to overwrite SDHCI IO memory accessors.

config MMC_SDHCI_BIG_ENDIAN_32BIT_BYTE_SWAPPER
	bool
	select MMC_SDHCI_IO_ACCESSORS
	help
	  This option is selected by drivers running on big endian hosts
	  and performing I/O to a SDHCI controller through a bus that
	  implements a hardware byte swapper using a 32-bit datum.
	  This endian mapping mode is called "data invariance" and
	  has the effect of scrambling the addresses and formats of data
	  accessed in sizes other than the datum size.

	  the S3C MCI driver.

config MMC_S3C_DMA
	bool "Use DMA transfers only (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
