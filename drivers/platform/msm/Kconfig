	bool "Qualcomm Single-wire Serial Bus Interface (SSBI)"
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  built-in SSBI interface on Qualcomm MSM family processors.

	  This is required for communicating with Qualcomm PMICs and
	  other devices that have the SSBI interface.

config SPS
	bool "SPS support"
	select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR
	help
	  The SPS (Smart Peripheral Switch) is a DMA engine.
	  It can move data in the following modes:
		1. Peripheral-to-Peripheral.
		2. Peripheral-to-Memory.
		3. Memory-to-Memory.

config USB_BAM
	boolean "USB BAM Driver"
	depends on SPS && USB_GADGET
	help
	  Enabling this option adds USB BAM Driver.
	  USB BAM driver was added to supports SPS Peripheral-to-Peripheral
	  transfers between the USB and other peripheral.

config SPS_SUPPORT_BAMDMA
	bool "SPS support BAM DMA"
	depends on SPS
	default n
	help
	  The BAM-DMA is used for Memory-to-Memory transfers.
	  The main use cases is RPC between processors.
	  The BAM-DMA hardware has 2 registers sets:
		1. A BAM HW like all the peripherals.
		2. A DMA channel configuration (i.e. channel priority).

config SPS_SUPPORT_NDP_BAM
	bool "SPS support NDP BAM"
	depends on SPS
	default n
	help
	  No-Data-Path BAM is used to improve BAM performance.

config QPNP_PWM
	depends on SPMI
	depends on OF_SPMI
        tristate "Qualcomm QPNP LPG/PWM support"
        help
          This driver supports PWM/LPG devices in Qualcomm PMIC chips which
          comply with QPNP.  QPNP is a SPMI based PMIC implementation.  These
          devices support Pulse Width Modulation output with user generated
          patterns. They share a lookup table with size of 64 entries.

config QPNP_POWER_ON
	tristate "QPNP PMIC POWER-ON Driver"
	depends on OF_SPMI && SPMI && MSM_QPNP_INT
	help
	  This driver supports the power-on functionality on Qualcomm
	  PNP PMIC. It currently supports reporting the change in status of
	  the KPDPWR_N line (connected to the power-key).

config QPNP_CLKDIV
	tristate "QPNP PMIC clkdiv driver"
	depends on OF_SPMI && SPMI
	help
	  This driver supports the clkdiv functionality on the Qualcomm
	  PNP PMIC. It configures the frequency of clkdiv outputs on the
	  PMIC. These clocks are typically wired through alternate functions
	  on gpio pins.

config QPNP_VIBRATOR
	tristate "Vibrator support for QPNP PMIC"
	depends on OF_SPMI
	help
	  This option enables device driver support for the vibrator
	  on the Qualcomm's QPNP PMICs. The vibrator is connected on the
	  VIB_DRV_N line and can be controlled manually or by the DTEST lines.
	  It uses the android timed-output framework.

config QPNP_REVID
	tristate "QPNP Revision ID Peripheral"
	depends on SPMI
	help
	  Say 'y' here to include support for the Qualcomm QPNP REVID
	  peripheral. REVID prints out the PMIC type and revision numbers
	  in the kernel log along with the PMIC option status. The PMIC
	  type is mapped to a Qualcomm chip part number and logged as well.

config QPNP_COINCELL
	tristate "Qualcomm QPNP coincell charger support"
	depends on SPMI && OF_SPMI
	help
	  This driver supports the QPNP coincell peripheral found inside of
	  Qualcomm QPNP PMIC devices.  The coincell charger provides a means to
	  charge a coincell battery or backup capacitor which is used to
	  maintain PMIC register state when the main battery is removed from the
	  mobile device.

config IPA
	tristate "IPA support"
	depends on SPS
	help
	  This driver supports the Internet Packet Accelerator (IPA) core.
	  IPA is a programmable protocol processor HW block.
	  It is designed to support generic HW processing of UL/DL IP packets
	  for various use cases independent of radio technology.
	  The driver support client connection and configuration
	  for the IPA core.
	  Kernel and user-space processes can call the IPA driver
	  to configure IPA core.
config MSM_AVTIMER
	tristate "Avtimer Driver"
	depends on MSM_QDSP6_APRV2
	help
		This driver gets the Q6 out of power collapsed state and
		exposes ioctl control to read avtimer tick.

config PFT
	bool "Per-File-Tagger driver"
	default n
	help
		This driver is used for tagging enterprise files.
		It is part of the Per-File-Encryption (PFE) feature.
		The driver is tagging files when created by
		registered application.
		Tagged files are encrypted using the dm-req-crypt driver.

config SSM
	tristate "Qualcomm Secure Service Module"
	depends on QSEECOM
	depends on MSM_SMD
	help
	  Provides an interface for OEM driver to communicate with Trustzone
	  and modem for key exchange and mode change.
	  This driver uses Secure Channel Manager interface for trustzone
	  communication and communicates with modem over SMD channel.
