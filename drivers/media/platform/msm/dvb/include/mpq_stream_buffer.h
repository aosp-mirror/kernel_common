/**
 * DOC: MPQ Stream Buffer
 *
 * A stream buffer implementation is used to transfer data between two units
 * such as demux and decoders. The implementation relies on dvb_ringbuffer
 * implementation. Refer to dvb_ringbuffer.h for details.
 *
 * The implementation uses two dvb_ringbuffers, one to pass the
 * raw-data (PES payload for example) and the other to pass
 * meta-data (information from PES header for example).
 *
 * The meta-data uses dvb_ringbuffer packet interface. Each meta-data
 * packet points to the data buffer, and includes the offset to the data in the
 * buffer, the size of raw-data described by the meta-data packet, and also the
 * size of user's own parameters if any required.
 *
 * Data can be managed in two ways: ring-buffer & linear buffers, as specified
 * in initialization when calling the mpq_streambuffer_init function.
 * For managing data as a ring buffer exactly 1 data buffer descriptor must be
 * specified in initialization. For this mode, dvb_ringbuffer is used "as-is".
 * For managing data in several linear buffers, an array of buffer descriptors
 * must be passed.
 * For both modes, data descriptor(s) must be remain valid throughout the life
 * span of the mpq_streambuffer object.
 * Apart from initialization API remains the same for both modes.
 *
 * Contrary to dvb_ringbuffer implementation, this API makes sure there's
 * enough data to read/write when making read/write operations.
 * Users interested to flush/reset specific buffer, check for bytes
 * ready or space available for write should use the respective services
 * in dvb_ringbuffer (dvb_ringbuffer_avail, dvb_ringbuffer_free,
 * dvb_ringbuffer_reset, dvb_ringbuffer_flush,
 * dvb_ringbuffer_flush_spinlock_wakeup).
 *
 * Concurrency protection is handled in the same manner as in
 * dvb_ringbuffer implementation.
 *
 * Typical call flow from producer:
 *
 * - Start writing the raw-data of new packet, the following call is
 *   repeated until end of data of the specific packet
 *
 *      mpq_streambuffer_data_write(...)
 *
 * - Now write a new packet describing the new available raw-data
 *      mpq_streambuffer_pkt_write(...)
 *
 *   For linear buffer mode, writing a new packet with data size > 0, causes the
 *   current buffer to be marked as pending for reading, and triggers moving to
 *   the next available buffer, that shall now be the current write buffer.
 *
 * Typical call flow from consumer:
 *
 * - Poll for next available packet:
 *      mpq_streambuffer_pkt_next(&streambuff,-1,&len)
 *
 *   In different approach, consumer can wait on event for new data and then
 *   call mpq_streambuffer_pkt_next, waiting for data can be done as follows:
 *
 *      wait_event_interruptible(
 *			streambuff->packet_data->queue,
 *			!dvb_ringbuffer_empty(&streambuff->packet_data) ||
 *			(streambuff->packet_data.error != 0);
 *
 * - Get the new packet information:
 *      mpq_streambuffer_pkt_read(..)
 *
 * - Read the raw-data of the new packet. Here you can use two methods:
 *
 *   1. Read the data to a user supplied buffer:
 *         mpq_streambuffer_data_read()
 *
 *      In this case memory copy is done, read pointer is updated in the raw
 *      data buffer, the amount of raw-data is provided part of the
 *      packet's information. User should then call mpq_streambuffer_pkt_dispose
 *      with dispose_data set to 0 as the raw-data was already disposed.
 *      Note that secure buffer cannot be accessed directly and an error will
 *      occur.
 *
 *   2. Access the data directly using the raw-data address. The address
 *      of the raw data is provided part of the packet's information. User
 *      then should call mpq_streambuffer_pkt_dispose with dispose_data set
 *      to 1 to dispose the packet along with it's raw-data.
 *
 * - Disposal of packets:
 *      mpq_streambuffer_pkt_dispose(...)
 *
 *   For linear buffer mode, disposing of a packet with data size > 0, causes
 *   the current buffer to be marked as free for writing, and triggers moving to
 *   the next available buffer, that shall now be the current read buffer.
