	  Enable the media controller API used to query media devices internal
	  topology and configure it dynamically.

	  This API is mostly used by camera interfaces in embedded platforms.

config VIDEO_DEV
	tristate "Video For Linux"
	---help---
	  V4L core support for video capture and overlay devices, webcams and
	  AM/FM radio cards.

	  This kernel includes support for the new Video for Linux Two API,
	  (V4L2).

	  Additional info and docs are available on the web at
	  <http://linuxtv.org>

	  Documentation for V4L2 is also available on the web at
	  <http://bytesex.org/v4l/>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called videodev.

config VIDEO_V4L2_COMMON
	tristate
	depends on (I2C || I2C=n) && VIDEO_DEV
	default (I2C || I2C=n) && VIDEO_DEV

config VIDEO_V4L2_SUBDEV_API

	depends on VIDEO_DEV && MEDIA_CONTROLLER && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  Enables the V4L2 sub-device pad-level userspace API used to configure
	  video format, size and frame rate between hardware blocks.

	  This API is mostly used by camera interfaces in embedded platforms.

	help
	  DVB core utility functions for device handling, software fallbacks etc.

	  Enable this if you own a DVB/ATSC adapter and want to use it or if
	  you compile Linux for a digital SetTopBox.

	  Say Y when you have a DVB or an ATSC card and want to use it.

	  API specs and user tools are available from <http://www.linuxtv.org/>.

	  Please report problems regarding this support to the LinuxDVB
	  mailing list.

	  If unsure say N.

config DVB_NET
	bool "DVB Network Support"
	default (NET && INET)
	depends on NET && INET && DVB_CORE
	help
	  This option enables DVB Network Support which is a part of the DVB
	  standard. It is used, for example, by automatic firmware updates used
	  on Set-Top-Boxes. It can also be used to access the Internet via the
	  DVB card, if the network provider supports it.

	  You may want to disable the network support on embedded devices. If
	  unsure say Y.

	tristate
	default (DVB_CORE && (VIDEO_DEV = n)) || (VIDEO_DEV && (DVB_CORE = n)) || (DVB_CORE && VIDEO_DEV)
