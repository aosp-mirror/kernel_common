	  Say Y here if you have a Synaptics RMI4 and
	  want to enable support for the built-in touchscreen
	  through staging driver.  Not to be confused with
	  TOUCHSCREEN_SYNAPTICS_I2C_RMI4 in
          drivers/input/touchscreen directory.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called synaptics_rmi4_ts.
