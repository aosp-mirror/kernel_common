/*
 * Notifications inform the MobiCore runtime environment that information is
 * pending in a WSM buffer.
 *
 * The Trustlet Connector (TLC) and the corresponding Trustlet also utilize
 * this buffer to notify each other about new data within the
 * Trustlet Connector Interface (TCI).
 *
 * The buffer is set up as a queue, which means that more than one
 * notification can be written to the buffer before the switch to the other
 * world is performed. Each side therefore facilitates an incoming and an
 * outgoing queue for communication with the other side.
 *
 * Notifications hold the session ID, which is used to reference the
 * communication partner in the other world.
 * So if, e.g., the TLC in the normal world wants to notify his Trustlet
 * about new data in the TLC buffer
 *
 * Notification queue declarations.
